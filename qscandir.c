/* qscandir.c
 *
 * libc's scandir is poorly standardized so I'll use a public domain version.
 * well... And modify it to return an argv rather than a dirent array.
 * The only field you can portably use in the dirent is the name anyway.
 * This uses a whole lot less memory than the original version.

 * ... these are public-domain implementations of the SystemV ftw()
 * routine, the BSD scandir() and alphasort() routines, and documentation for
 * same.  The FTW manpage could be more readable, but so it goes.
 *
 * Anyhow, feel free to post these, and incorporate them into your existing

 *  wants them, and should have them for VMS by the end of January; let me
 *  know if you want copies.
