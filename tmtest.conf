# This adds the directory that contains this file to $PATH.
# This means that while the test is running, any executables in
# this directory will take priority over similarly-named executables
# in other directories.

# When you run "tmtest" in the test directories, you will run the
# installed program (/usr/local/bin/tmtest).  Presumably this is
# a relatively stable version.  When the testfile launches tmtest,
# however, it will launch the version in this directory.
# So, the stable tmtest tests the unstable one.
