Bash Bugs:

Bash3 has removed the ability to set LINENO, so you may see the
wrong line number be printed if there's an error.  The workaround
suggested by the Bash author is far too large and complex.
Downgrading to Bash2 works much better.  I don't understand why
this functionality was removed in the first place!


The <<-EOL operator strips ALL tabs from the front of each line.
This is bad because it means you can't nest heredocs:

	cmd1 <<-EOL
		cmd2 <<-EOL
			cmd3
		EOL
	EOL

The first heredoc flattens everything and then the EOLs get mixed up.
What bash SHOULD do is discover the whitespace sequence indenting the
first line of a heredoc, then remove that sequence from all subsequent
lines.  If a line doesn't begin with exactly that sequence, then
it is unchanged.  This would be much safer and more useful than just
blowing away all tabs wholesale!
