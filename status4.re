/** This is the file substate of the cb scanner.
 * It tries to scan a filename.  It returns either
 * CBFILE if the filename name could be scanned
 * or GARBAGE if it couldn't.
 *
 * Well, it's been simplified a lot now that we don't attempt to quote
 * filenames.  The filename just extends from the current cursor position
 * to the end of the line.  This scanner always returns a CBFILE token
 * and resets the start state.  It could go away completely if re2c
 * would support capturing parentheses (but that would probably require
 * a rewrite...)
