# First create the commands

./56-echo.cmd: execfile = <<EOL
#!/bin/sh
echo one $*
EOL

./56-cat.cmd: execfile = <<EOL
#!/bin/sh
echo "try to get"
cat
EOL


# Now creat the config file

./56-ExecutableHeader.conf: file = <<EOL
executable: echo=$(CURPATH)/56-echo.cmd cat=$(CURPATH)/56-cat.cmd
EOL



# Now, run tmtest.  If everything works, it should run the fabricated
# command in /tmp, rather than the built-in echo.  Note that we're also
# using a custom version of cat that prepends the string "try to get"
# before any of its output.

tmtest -o -f ./56-ExecutableHeader.conf - <<EOL
echo up | cat
------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
try to get
one up
EOL


------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
echo up | cat
------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
try to get
one up
