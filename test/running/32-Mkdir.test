# and that it will be deleted when the test is finished.

# MKFILE is provided by files.sh, which is automatically
# included by tmtest.conf


# first, we choose a filename for the subtest to create
fn=`mktemp -t`

# then we run the subtest.  It uses MKTEMP to create the file and
# fill it with data (technically, the empty file was created by the
# mktemp(1) call above)
