title: Indented Command
Author: Scott Bronson
Date:   14 Nov 2004

# The problem here is that the command is indented using spaces
# while everything else is indented using tabs.  This means that
# the command is indented in the heredoc, and is therefore a
# continuation of the previous Date header.

# I don't know how to fix this.  :(  This test at least standardizes
# tmtest's behavior.  You can see that the command isn't run because
# there's no "howdy!" in the stdout.
