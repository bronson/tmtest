# This ensures that we can run a series of tests named on the command line.
# This is like test 30, except that the middle one bails.

/tmp/30-temporary-1.test = <<-EOL
	# Temporary test
	echo "hi from 1"
	------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
	hi from 1
EOL

/tmp/30-temporary-2.test = <<-EOL
	# Temporary test
	sh -c exit 12
	------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
	hi from 2
EOL

/tmp/30-temporary-3.test = <<-EOL
	# Temporary test
	echo "hi from 3"
	------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
	hi from 3
EOL

tmtest /tmp/30-temporary-1.test \
	/tmp/30-temporary-2.test \
	/tmp/30-temporary-3.test


# ... and this should be the result of running the above tests.

------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
ok   30-temporary-1.test           
FAIL 30-temporary-2.test
