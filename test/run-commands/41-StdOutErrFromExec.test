# Stdout and Stderr From Executable File
# author: Scott Bronson

#
# We should be able to redirect both stdout and stderr from an executed file.
# This example comes from the testfile documentation.

41-tmpfile = +x <<-EOF
	#!/bin/sh
	perl -e 'print STDOUT "this goes to out\n"'
	perl -e 'print STDERR "this goes to err\n"'
EOF

# Here we actually run the test, passing the single complex command:

tmtest -o - <<-EOF

	./41-tmpfile

	------ STDERR:
	this goes to err
	------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
	this goes to out
EOF

# And the output of the above tmtest command:

------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error

./41-tmpfile

------ STDERR:
this goes to err
------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
this goes to out
