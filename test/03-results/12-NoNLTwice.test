# This test verifies that if we specify -n AND the file doesn't end in a
# newline that the test will still succeed.

# This file does not end in a newline!  If there's a newline at the end of
# this file then some editor or version control program messed it up.

# NOTE: it is unfortunate that we're testing the currently installed
# tmtest, not the tmtest that we SHOULD be testing.

# Uses the head command to trim the final \r from the testfile.
