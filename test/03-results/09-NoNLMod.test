# Ensures that a test's stdout need not end in "\n" for the test
# to pass (see --no-trailing-newline in testfile(5).  This adds a
# modify clause because, alas, using a modify clause changes the
# code path for the comparison.  This is one reason why modify
# clauses are evil...
#
# Also see: 09-NoNL.test

# (back when we were parsing tests using re2c, lines needed to be
# less than BUFSIZ and the results always had to end in a newline).
