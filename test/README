Why have a copy of tmtest in the test directory?

We can't expect tmtest to test itself (unless we know tmtest has no
known bugs (in which case why are we running tmtest (...)))

So...

	test/tmtest   a known working and stable version
	tmtest        the program under development that's being tested


This recursion also leads to some very strange looking tests.
If you're creating tests for your program, I suggest you use the
tests from the example directory or another project.  Most of
the tests in this directory are fairly deranged.
