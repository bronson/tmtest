NOTE: If you are looking for examples of testfiles, this is NOT the
directory for you!  Due to the recursive nature of tmtest testing
itself, many of these testfiles are very difficult to understand.

See the examples directory instead.


These are the test subcategories:

00-cmdline: tests parsing command-line arguments
    Mostly tests illegal command-line arguments.

01-testfile: tests the parsing of test files.
    Mostly tests illegal testfiles and ensures proper errors are printed.

02-running: tests running the actual tests
    Ensures that the test environment is set up properly.
    For instance, checks that disabled tests are not run,
    tmlib functions behave correctly, etc.

03-results: tests the results
    Ensures that we compare the test results properly.
    For instance, verifies that we handle results that don't
    end in newlines, binary characters, etc. properly.  If it doesn't
	exercise the comparison code, a test doesn't belong in here.

04-diff: ensures diffing and patching works

09-docs: tests that appear in our documentation.
    This ensures that tmtest behaves exactly like our docs say it will.
