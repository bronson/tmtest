# Explodes the given test all over the /tmp/tmtest directory.
# Like 01, except that it ensures that crfiles include their extensions as well.

# This ensures that we don't get a "Moved existing files to tmpdir" message.
# Note that this is inherently dangerous!!  I may want to rethink this...
rm -rf /tmp/tmtest
