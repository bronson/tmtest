# Ensure we don't leak fds to the running test.
# Ideally, there would be NO open FDs.  This will be the case for tmtest 0.98.

# This used to output the following text but platforms just differ too
# much exactly what fds they leave open.  So, just so long as there's 4
# fds open, we're as happy as we can be.
#    open: 4
#    open: 6
#    open: 7
#    open: 10

DISABLED: Number of open fds keeps changing.
