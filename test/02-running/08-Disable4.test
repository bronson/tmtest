# Verifies what happens when a test is disabled and gives 
# only whitespace as a reason.

# this is really weird...  I would expect the colon to be printed
# because we DO have a disabled reason -- it's just empty.  But
# for some reason it's not.  I'd like to know why.  TODO
# dis  (STDIN)                   :
