# DiffNoNL

# If this test fails but PatchNoNL doesn't then you're probably using a
# non-Gnu diff and patch programs.  As long as 21 works, you're in good
# shape.  Please send me the output of 'tmtest -o 20-DiffNoNL.test' so
# I can update this test.
#
# If both DiffNoNL and PatchNoNL fail, your diff and patch programs are
# buggy and you should probably update them.
