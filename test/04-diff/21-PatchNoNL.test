# Ensures that patch can handle diffs that remove the trailing newline.

# If ONLY this test fails, then chances are the patch utility installed

# This is a little exotic...  Patch needs the CWD to be the directory
# containing the file to patch.  "dirname $(tt.test)" gives that dir.
# Ignore stderr because we want to ignore the warning that tmtest prints
# about the sections not having matching trailing newlines.

echo "(since there's no trailing newline, DONE should appear on the prevous line)"

STDOUT:

And the patched file:
    echo -n "right output"
    STDOUT:
    right output<<DONE>>
(since there's no trailing newline, DONE should appear on the prevous line)
