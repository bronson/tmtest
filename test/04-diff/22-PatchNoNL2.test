# Ensures that patch can handle diffs that remove the trailing newline.
# Except that we wedge it by putting the STDERR clause right after the
# STDOUT.

# Since STDOUT includes no trailing newline, STDERR ends up on the end
# of the last STDOUT line.  This is not real good, but at least it
# guarantees that the test will fail until the user fixes it.

# This is a little exotic...  Patch needs the CWD to be the directory
# containing the file to patch.  "dirname $(tt.test)" gives that dir.
