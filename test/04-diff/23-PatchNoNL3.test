# Ensures that patch can handle diffs that remove the trailing newline.
# In this case, patch adds a newline to a section that erroneously
# didn't have one.

# By the time we get to the end of the STDOUT section, it's too late to
# remove the "-n".  Therefore, we just add another newline.  If the
# section has two newlines but suppresses one, it matches the output's
# single newline exactly.


MKFILE tt <<-EOL
	echo "right output"
	STDOUT: -n
	right output
EOL


# This is a little exotic...  Patch needs the CWD to be the directory
# containing the file to patch.  "dirname $(tt.test)" gives that dir.

tmtest --all-files -d "$tt" | (cd `dirname "$tt"` && patch | FIX_PATCH)
echo "And the patched file:"
INDENT < "$tt"
echo "<<DONE>>"

STDOUT:
patching FILE
And the patched file:
  echo "right output"
  STDOUT: -n
  right output
  
<<DONE>>
