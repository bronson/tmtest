# If a section is marked as having a trailing newline, but one wasn't
# found in the actual output, we need to print a warning.

# By the time we figure out that the section didn't end in a trailing
# newline, we've long since output the section header and so we missed
# our chance to fix it ourselves.  Therefore, we'll warn the user that
# he has to fix it himself).  It's also too late to stop ourselves from
# outputting an incorrect patch.  No problem -- user can make the change
# and patch again, fixing the problem.
