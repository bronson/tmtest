# This is like 17-ConfigError in the running directory except
# that it performs a diff.

# TODO: We pipe stderr to stdout so it can be rewritten.
# This needs to be changed!!

# BUG: notice that the diff IS STILL PRODUCED!  It just erases
# all the sections.  This is bad, of course.  Unfortunately,
# until we have dynamic status and can terminate the test
# before the main file gets executed, we can't stop diff from
# producing output.
# Hopefully this gets fixed in 2.2.
