author: Scott Bronson

desc: 	Ensures that -f works to import a config file. \
		(the config file ensures the test won't run due to version mismatch)


# create the config file

tt.conf: file = <<-EOL
	require-tmtest: 100
EOL


# run the test

tmtest -f $(tt.conf) - <<-EOL
	echo "may"
	------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
	may
EOL


# If the test is skipped, then we know that the configuration
# file was properly read.

------ STDOUT: exit code 0 - no error
skip STDIN
