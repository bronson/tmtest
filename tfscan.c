SOME MORE THOUGHTS ON SCANNING:


We know we're at the beginning of the buffer or immediately
after a newline.
	Do we have enough data for a keyword?
		No: fill buffer with more data.
	We know we have enough data for a keyword.  Use strstr.
	
See if a keyword is here.
If 


So what's the problem?
	Read might return:
		error, just return error code as negative number.
		0, eof.
			If we have more data in the buffer, we need to make sure
			to return that data.
			(actaully, with re2c, that's not the case.  It screws up the
			last token in the file unless the file ends on a token delimiter).
			- If there's no more data in the buffer then we just return 0.
		positive number: we read data.

So the problem is that re2c scanners can't handle it if the file doesn't
end on a token delim.  We can't return if we hit eol and haven't scanned
more data even if there's more data in the buffer.  The stupid re2c
scanner will just start scanning in the garbage past the end of the buffer.
Sigh.

That means I can't use it for the testfile scanner.

That furthermore means that I can't use YYFILL on the non-broken scanner.
I should probably add a different macro that can be used everywhere,
zero-length reads (as in a network packet), file ending with a non-delim
character, etc.
