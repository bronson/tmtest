=head1 NAME

tmtest - run a battery of compliance tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tmtest> [B<-d>|B<-o>] [I<dir>|I<testfile>...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-d> B<--diff>

Prints a diff of the expected results against the actual results.
The expected results are the lines prefixed with a '-',
and the actual results are prefixed with a '+'.
In other words, the '+' lines are ones that the test erroneously added,
and the '-' lines are ones that the test erroneously didn't print.

You can pipe the output straight into the patch
program to modify the test files.  This works when running tests
in subdirectories too, but you need to invoke C<patch -p0> becaue
the patch utility doesn't enter subdirectories by default.

    tmtest -d | less        # view patch to ensure no bad changes
    tmtest -d | patch -p0   # update every file (beware!)

DANGER!!!  This is the perfect way to let subtle bugs slip
into your test deck.  Make sure you know I<exactly> what is
being changed, right down to the whitespace.

=head1 TUTORIAL

=head1 HISTORY

The original tmtest was written in June of 2000 when I got frustrated
with the TrestleMail mail relay program.  TrestleMail had become quite
large and complex but required some significant reorganization for version
0.8.  I wrote tmtest as a quick one-off Perl hack to allow me to tear
tmtest to pieces and have some hope of getting the pieces back together.

tmtest worked worked so well that I adapted it to a few other projects.
And after gluing on feature after feature over the years, tmtest finally
reached 1.0 in late 2004.

The Perl version had become far too large and complex.  So, in early 2005,
I rewrote the good parts in C.  This became tmtest 2.0.
