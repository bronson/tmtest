It is very hard to write tests before the functionality in the
product works pretty well.  This is because it's normally so tedious
to hand-generate output.

So, typically you'd get a feature up and working.  The first moment
it works, you write a test for it.  Any time you find a bug, write
a test, correct the test output, and then fix the program until the
test passes.

At first this seems pointless.  I mean, what good is 6 lousy tests
going to do anybody?  But, give it time.  Once you have 50
tests, you can start to feel pretty confident that a lot of code
paths in your program are being exercised.  If you have a hundred
or more, they will probably help you find mistakes you've made.


DIFFICULTY: if you have 40 tests all testing a feature, and you
make a silly syntax change to that feature, you will have to hand-
update all 40 files.
