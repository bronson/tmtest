Create tests:

Calling with unkown switches, both short and long.
Not specifying values for switches that take values.
Naming the test on the command line
Naming a dir on the command line
Naming a file that doesn't end in ".test" on the command line.

2.0:
- Make output/diffing support the pcrs substitution too.
- Test 25 has a weird howdy appear on stdout.
- put the config files explicitly in the exec, rather than looping over them
- the status file is too goddamn difficult to parse.
    think of a real format instead of a stupid logfile format.
- Make diff work in subdirs (need to cd back to superdir before
  forking, and use the proper partial path for the file)
- Ensure that diffing works when running multiple tests in multiple dirs.
- get rid of all the exit(10) calls in test.c.  We need a better way to abort the test.
- write a function that allows you to disable the test.
- write a function to make it easy to create crfiles.
?:
- allow multiple s/// expressions on a single line.  will probably require modifications to pcrs_compile_command, so make it support buf/len at the same time.

2.2:
- Add the ability to run multiple tests from one testfile
- Change the I/O scheme to be event based.  Get rid of the tempfiles.
  Convert to using the async io library.  Don't use temporary files.
- Unify the line modifier in compare.c and test.c.
?:
- Provide some sort of XML output.

2.4:
- add the ability to run valgrind over each test and print success/failure of that.
  There should be a way to run it with valgrind.


Never:

It's a shame that bash can't print the correct line numbers when
    feeding the script on stdin.
