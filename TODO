- make tmtest support -f config-file

- Write a manpage for tmtest.  First should be a quick reference,
  then should come a nice tutorialy ssection

- Document the format of tests run by tmtest

- should add a pre-test script and a post-test script to the test
  file.  That way the tester could rearrange stuff to test just
  about anything.

- Should add output file support.  You name the file in the script,
  tmtest will delete/empty the file at the start of the test, then
  check file contents at the end.

It's easy to integrate both.  In the startup script, you do either:
   >out.file   # empty the file
   rm out.file # delete the file
Then, to test files, you simply include them in the expected output!

- Make tmtest use mime separators to report expected test output.
  That way, I don't have to worry about escaping test output in test output.

- Have an "output to directory" option, where all the tests you run
  are NOT checked against the expected results.  They just store
  the actual results in a separate directory.  This way, if you made
  a small change that breaks a ton of tests, you can output a bunch
  of new test files, run a recursive diff to make sure all the changes
  are expected, then check in the new tests.
