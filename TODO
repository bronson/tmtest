1.0:
- Make "make test" work.
- write tests for nesting testfiles with --config.
        // If the user specifies a config file, we only check directories
        // not above the given config file.  i.e. if user specifies
        // "tmtest -c /a/b/cc /a/t/u/t.test", we will look for config files
        // in /a/t/tmtest.conf and /a/t/u/tmtest.conf.

- merge tmtestlib and tmtestrc.  They're now basically the same file.
- Add STDOUT: trimws and STDERR: trimws - to trim whitespace from
  the front of each output line.
- It's silly to have the utilities all in separate files.
  Should have a standard tmtest library that includes the most useful ones,
  installed in /usr/share (or some other shared dir) by default.
- get rid of all the exit(10) calls in test.c.  We need a better way to
  abort the test.
  should get rid of a whole bunch in main.c as well.
  this should prevent us from dropping turds in /tmp all the time too.
- what do we do when stdout is missing a newline at the end?
  Test that both raw and modified work when stdout doesn't have a newline.
  Check that diff works too.
- Get rid of AUTHOR and DATE in all the test files and docs.
  We'll purge it from the code in a year if it looks like a good idea.

1.2:
- stdin is all buggered up.  why is it that "cat" with no args will print
  the rest of the test script?  And why is it that if you fork, diff freezes?
  They're related problems I suspect.
- Could take tests from tarfiles.  We would decompress the tarfile into
  a temporary directory, run the test, and delete the tarfile.  This will
  make it easier to maintain tests that all need to be run in a certain
  directory hierarchy.
- Tighten up printing a folder name when there are no files in it.  No need for double spacing.
- Change the I/O scheme to be event based.  Get rid of the tempfiles.
  Convert to using the async io library.  Don't use temporary files.
  This would allow us to recognize that the test is disabled before
     producing a partial diff, thus saving the user from blowing away his files.
- Add the ability to run multiple tests from one testfile
- allow multiple s/// expressions on a single line.  will probably require modifications to pcrs_compile_command, so make it support buf/len at the same time.
- add the ability to run valgrind over each test and print success/failure of that.
- add gcov support so you can see what sort of coverage your tests provide.

?:
- Shouldn't run every test in a dir if the DISABLED directive is in a config file.
  Should discover what dir the DISABLED directive came from and refuse
  to run anything below that.
- Rewrite the test date and author if they aren't supplied.
- should probably indent stdout and stderr clauses two spaces.  otherwise
  we might misinterpret STDOUT: and STDERR: in a stdout or stderr clause.
- Provide some sort of XML output.
- it's stupid to dup the str just to null-terminate it so it can be passed to pcrs.
  modify pcrs to compile buffers too.

????:
- Unify the line modifier in compare.c and test.c.  It's hackish now.
- There should be a way to repeatedly run a single test with only tiny
  differences.  i.e. test all permeutations of DISABLE DISABLE:
  DISABLED DISABLED:  Hopefully that will clean up 05-08-Disable/Abort.test
- There should be a way of discovering that you copied a file and changed
  its functionality.  that way, tmtest will update its author and date.
- Add a timeout that will terminate stalled tests.  You can set the timeout in the config file.



- Wow, the pcrs error messages suck.  Is there any way to improve them?
  "(pcrs:) Syntax error while parsing command (-11)."


maybe never:
- add a CLEAR_EACHLINE or CLEAR_MODIFY option to to turn off all substitutions.
  It would be easy to do.  I'm just not convinced that anyone would find it useful.
