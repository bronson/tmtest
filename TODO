- Make tmtest use mime separators to report expected test output.
  That way, I don't have to worry about escaping test output in test output.

- Make tests somewhat self-aware.  I.e.
  "I'm like B, but more complex -- more specific"
  "I'm like B, but simpler, and should work more often"
  That way, if all tests go red, it's easy to get tmtest to tell
  you where you should start digging in.  Theoretically, getting
  the more broad tests working might fix the more specific ones too.

  This requires the header changes.

- should allow specifying regexps or other executable code to determine
  if the test succeeds or fails.  The exact match might not be useful
  everywhere.

- It's awful hard syntactically to tell files from commands.  Is there
  any way to make them distinct in the test file?
 

Maybe never:

Completely revamp the testfile format:
	- I'll wait until I can use Perl6 rules to parse the test file.
	- Everything is either a header, a command, or a crfile (or comment).
	- Headers can take heredocs ("stdout: <<EOL")
	- stdout, stderr, and exitcode are specified using headers

This way, the exit clause is gone for good, and testfiles are much
easier to parse.  Too bad it's such a big change...
