Create tests:

Calling with unkown switches, both short and long.
Not specifying values for switches that take values.
Naming the test on the command line
Naming a dir on the command line
Naming a file that doesn't end in ".test" on the command line.


Longer term:

Make the tempname a lot harder to guess.  gen_tempname()
Make the OOB separator somewhat random.  var_oob_separator()
Add the ability to run multiple tests from one testfile
Do everything with unlinked files.
