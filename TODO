2.0:
- get rid of all the exit(10) calls in test.c.  We need a better way to abort the test.
  should get rid of a whole bunch in main.c as well.
  this should prevent us from dropping turds in /tmp all the time.
- Rewrite the test date and author if they aren't supplied.
- Shouldn't run every test in a dir if the DISABLED directive is in a config file.
  Should discover what dir the DISABLED directive came from and refuse
  to run anything above that.
- what do we do when stdout is missing a newline?
  Test that both raw and modified work when stdout doesn't have a newline.

2.2:
- Tighten up printing a folder name when there are no files in it.  No need for double spacing.
- Change the I/O scheme to be event based.  Get rid of the tempfiles.
  Convert to using the async io library.  Don't use temporary files.
  This would allow us to recognize that the test is disabled before
     producing a partial diff, thus saving the user from blowing away his files.
- Add the ability to run multiple tests from one testfile
- allow multiple s/// expressions on a single line.  will probably require modifications to pcrs_compile_command, so make it support buf/len at the same time.
- add the ability to run valgrind over each test and print success/failure of that.
- add gcov support so you can see what sort of coverage your tests provide.
?:
- should probably indent stdout and stderr clauses two spaces.  otherwise
  we might misinterpret STDOUT: and STDERR: in a stdout or stderr clause.
- Provide some sort of XML output.
- it's stupid to dup the str just to null-terminate it so it can be passed to pcrs.
  modify pcrs to compile buffers too.

????:
- Unify the line modifier in compare.c and test.c.  It's hackish now.
- There should be a way to repeatedly run a single test with only tiny
  differences.  i.e. test all permeutations of DISABLE DISABLE:
  DISABLED DISABLED:  Hopefully that will clean up 05-08-Disable/Abort.test
- There should be a way of discovering that you copied a file and changed
  its functionality.  that way, tmtest will update its author and date.
- Add a timeout that will terminate stalled tests.  You can set the timeout in the config file.



- Wow, the pcrs error messages suck.  Is there any way to improve them?
  "(pcrs:) Syntax error while parsing command (-11)."


maybe never:
- add a CLEAR_EACHLINE or CLEAR_MODIFY option to to turn off all substitutions.
  It would be easy to do.  I'm just not convinced that anyone would find it useful.
