Create tests:

Calling with unkown switches, both short and long.
Not specifying values for switches that take values.
Naming the test on the command line
Naming a dir on the command line
Naming a file that doesn't end in ".test" on the command line.

2.0:
- Make output/diffing support the pcrs substitution too.
- Test 25 has a weird howdy appear on stdout.
- put the config files explicitly in the exec, rather than looping over them
- the status file is too goddamn difficult to parse.
    think of a real format instead of a stupid logfile format.
- Make diff work in subdirs (need to cd back to superdir before
  forking, and use the proper partial path for the file)
- figure out whether to call it MODIFY or EACHLINE.
  clean up the syntax.
- add a CLEAR_EACHLINE option or something, to turn off all modifications.
- Ensure that diffing works when running multiple tests in multiple dirs.
- get rid of all the exit(10) calls in test.c.  We need a better way to abort the test.
- write a function that allows you to disable the test.
- write a function to make it easy to create crfiles.
- Rewrite the test date and author if they aren't supplied.
?:
- allow multiple s/// expressions on a single line.  will probably require modifications to pcrs_compile_command, so make it support buf/len at the same time.

2.2:
- Add the ability to run multiple tests from one testfile
- Change the I/O scheme to be event based.  Get rid of the tempfiles.
  Convert to using the async io library.  Don't use temporary files.
- Unify the line modifier in compare.c and test.c.
- add the ability to run valgrind over each test and print success/failure of that.
- add gcov support so you can see what sort of coverage your tests provide.
?:
- Provide some sort of XML output.
- it's stupid to dup the str just to null-terminate it so it can be passed to pcrs.
  modify pcrs to compile buffers too.


- Wow, the pcrs error messages suck.  Is there any way to improve them?
  "(pcrs:) Syntax error while parsing command (-11)."


Never:

It's a shame that bash 3 can't print the correct line numbers when
feeding the script on stdin.  Bash 2 works fine.  For no good reason
bash3 no longer allows you to set LINENO.  Weird.
