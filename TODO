- make tmtest support -f config-file

- Write a manpage for tmtest.  First should be a quick reference,
  then should come a nice tutorialy ssection

- Document the format of tests run by tmtest

- should add a pre-test script and a post-test script to the test
  file.  That way the tester could rearrange stuff to test just
  about anything.

- Should add output file support.  You name the file in the script,
  tmtest will delete/empty the file at the start of the test, then
  check file contents at the end.

It's easy to integrate both.  In the startup script, you do either:
   >out.file   # empty the file
   rm out.file # delete the file
Then, to test files, you simply include them in the expected output!

- Make tmtest use mime separators to report expected test output.
  That way, I don't have to worry about escaping test output in test output.

- Have an "output to directory" option, where all the tests you run
  are NOT checked against the expected results.  They just store
  the actual results in a separate directory.  This way, if you made
  a small change that breaks a ton of tests, you can output a bunch
  of new test files, run a recursive diff to make sure all the changes
  are expected, then check in the new tests.

- Make tests somewhat self-aware.  I.e.
  "I'm like B, but more complex -- more specific"
  "I'm like B, but simpler, and should work more often"
  That way, if all tests go red, it's easy to get tmtest to tell
  you where you should start digging in.  Theoretically, getting
  the more broad tests working might fix the more specific ones too.

  This requires the header changes.

- should use config files to make the parent exit clause and child
  exit clause visually distinct.  (only in tmtest tesdts)

- should allow specifying regexps or other executable code to determine
  if the test succeeds or fails.  This exact match might not be useful
  everywhere.

- Should give the internal tests distinct comments from the external
  tests.
 
- Make header totally free-form.  Remove the need to explicitly declare
  a title for the test.

- It's awful hard syntactically to tell files from commands.  Is there
  any way to make them distinct?
