# TODO: write a function that allows you to disable the test.
# TODO: write a function to make it easy to create crfiles.

Create tests:

Calling with unkown switches, both short and long.
Not specifying values for switches that take values.
Naming the test on the command line
Naming a dir on the command line
Naming a file that doesn't end in ".test" on the command line.


Longer term:

the status file is too goddamn difficult to parse.
    think of a real format instead of a stupid logfile format.
put the config files explicitly in the exec, rather than looping over them
Make the tempname a lot harder to guess.  gen_tempname()
Add the ability to run multiple tests from one testfile
print a warning if a result section is found with nonws chars (test_parse_section())
print a warning if a SECTION: is found (needs to be SECTION : , with a space)
Provide some sort of XML output.


It's a shame that bash can't print the correct line numbers when
    feeding the script on stdin.
