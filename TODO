0.94:
- An empty test with a STDOUT clause should fail without the -n right?
  I mean, there's no newline in the actual output, but there is in the
  expected...
- write tests for nesting testfiles with --config.
        // If the user specifies a config file, we only check directories
        // not above the given config file.  i.e. if user specifies
        // "tmtest -c /a/b/cc /a/t/u/t.test", we will look for config files
        // in /a/t/tmtest.conf and /a/t/u/tmtest.conf.
- Add the ability to specify test arguments on the command line.
  I'm picturing something where VAR=val on the command line would be
  inserted without change into the template.  That way you can use the
  command line to override default settings in the testfile.
  - This would allow us to test almost every test to ensure it
    supports the --config argument (make them DISABLED or something).

0.96:
- Change the I/O scheme to be event based.  Get rid of the tempfiles.
  Convert to using the async io library.  Don't use temporary files.
  This would allow us to recognize that the test is disabled before
  producing a partial diff, blowing away output sections.
- Use i/o lib for everything.  No need for temp files.
  This means that we stream everything EXCEPT stderr, which we memory
  buffer.  If your stderr is more than 100K or so in size, just redirect
  it to stdout.
- stdin is all buggered up.  why is it that "cat" with no args will print
  the rest of the test script?  And why is it that if you fork, diff freezes?
  They're related problems I suspect.
    Is it because I'm forgetting to close all open filehandles before forking?
- Tighten up printing a folder name when there are no testfiles in it.
  No need for double spacing.
- Add the ability to run multiple tests from one testfile.
  See tmtest 0.8 for a potential implementation of this.
  All we'd need to add is a framework to notify the user that multiple
  tests are in progress; bash can take care of the rest.
- Shouldn't run every test in a dir if the DISABLED directive is in a config
  file.
  Should discover what dir the DISABLED directive came from and refuse
  to run anything below that.
  - Yes, if a config file returns DISABLED, then that folder and all its
    subfolders are skipped.  Just make the test itself call the DISABLED
	command if you want testing to continue in that subfolder.
- Print a warning if we notice that an output section doesn't end in
  a newline, but the testfile hasn't marked that section with a "-n".
  See 22-PatchNoNL2.test for more.  Make sure a test for this is in 03 too.

0.98:
- get rid of all the exit(10) calls in test.c.  We need a better way to
  abort the test.
  should get rid of a whole bunch in main.c as well.
  this should prevent us from dropping turds in /tmp all the time too.
- Get rid of MODIFY clauses.  It's unnecessary complexity.
  And it's a LOT.  First remove it from the tests, then from the code.

1.0:

?:
- add gcov support so you can see what sort of coverage your tests provide.
- Provide some sort of automatable XML output?
- Could take tests from tarfiles.  We would decompress the tarfile into
  a temporary directory, run the test, and delete the tarfile.  This will
  make it easier to maintain tests that all need to be run in a certain
  directory hierarchy.
- add the ability to run valgrind over each test and print success/failure
  of that.  (gives deep valgrind coverage)
  - One problem with this will be all the false warnings.

No longer a problem when we dump pcrs:
- allow multiple s/// expressions on a single line.  will probably require
  modifications to pcrs_compile_command, so make it support buf/len at the
  same time.  These might be non-trivial changes...
- it's stupid to dup the str just to null-terminate it so it can be passed
  to pcrs.  Modify pcrs to compile buffers too.
- Unify the line modifier in compare.c and test.c.  It's hackish now.
- Wow, the pcrs error messages truly suck.  Is there any way to improve them?
  "(pcrs:) Syntax error while parsing command (-11)."
- add a CLEAR_EACHLINE or CLEAR_MODIFY option to to turn off all substitutions.
  It would be easy to do.  I'm just not convinced that anyone would find it
  useful.

????:
- There should be a way to repeatedly run a single test with only tiny
  differences.  i.e. test all permeutations of DISABLE DISABLE:
  DISABLED DISABLED:  Hopefully that will clean up 05-08-Disable/Abort.test
- Add a timeout that will terminate stalled tests.  You can set the timeout
  in the config file or the test itself.

maybe never:
- Add STDOUT: trimws and STDERR: trimws - to trim whitespace from
  the front of each output line.
  I wanted to add this to simulate the "STDOUT=<<-EOL" heredoc sequence
  of the original tests (that is nestable, unlinke Bash's.  But now I
  realize that this problem is pretty much solved from the other direction.
  Instead of removing indentation from the heredoc, simply add indentation
  using a MODIFY section (as detailed in the FAQ).
- Add a "FAILURE-OK" flag for when failure IS an option.  This would print
  that the test failed, but would not highlight it, and would not count
  either positively or negatively toward the test results.  That way you
  can include experimental tests in a production test stack (say you're
  developing a test and want to know if it's a good idea...)
