/** @file r2scan.h
 *
 * This is the central file for the readers.  They provide data
 * for scanners.
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * All charptrs in the scanstate structure are declared const to help
 * ensure that you don't
 * accidentally end up modifying the buffer as it's being scanned.
 * This means that your read routine must cast them to be mutable
 * (char*) before read them.
 *
 * TERMINOLOGY
 *
 * allocate: scanstates can be dynamically (dynamicscan_create()) or
 * statically (scanstate_init()) allocated.  The buffers they use to
 * hold data may also be either dynamic or static.  Of course, any
 * time you allocate something dynamically, you must call the
 * corresponding free routine when you're done with it.
 *
 * attach: when the scanner is first initialized (scanstate_init())
 * or allocated (dynamicscan_create()), it is blank.  Trying to
 * pass it to a scanner would result in an assert or a crash.
 * You need to first attach a READER to provide data.
 *
 * initialize: prepare an already-allocated scanner for use.
 * After initializing it, you must ATTACH the scanner to a
 * READER.
 *
 * reader: reads data into the scanstate for the scanner.
 * Examples are readmem.c (read from a contiguous block in
 * memory), readfp.c (read from a FILE*), readfd.c (read
 * from a Unix file descriptor), etc.
 *
 * scanner: the function that actually performs the scanning.
 * It may or may not be written with the assistance of re2c.
 * It accepts a scanstate data structure and returns the next
 * token in the stream.
 *
 * scanstate: the data structure that retains complete state for the
 * scanner.  Scanners are thread safe: they never, ever use global
 * state.

/** Prototype of read function
 *
 * You only need to read this if you're writing your own read functions.
 *
 * This function is used to fetch more data for the scanner.  It must
 * first shift the pointers in ss to make room (see read_shiftbuffer())
 * then load new data into the unused bytes at the end of the buffer.
 *
 * This routine returns 0 when there's no more data (EOF).
 * If it returns a value less than 0, that value will be returned
 * to the caller instead of a token.  This can indicate an error
 * condition, or just a situation such as EWOULDBLOCK.
 *
 * minbytes tells the minimum number of bytes that must be loaded.  If
 * you cannot load at least this many bytes, you must return 0.  It is
 * illegal for the scanner to return value between 0 and minbytes.
 * If you hit eof, and you can't satisfy minbytes, then return 0.
 * Otherwise, negative means error, and positive means the read was
 * successful and the scanner now has enough data to continue.
 *
 * All charptrs in the scanstate structure are declared const to help
 * ensure that you don't
 * accidentally end up modifying the buffer as it's being scanned.
 * This means that your read routine must cast them to be mutable
 * (char*) before reading them.
 *
 * It's too bad this declaration can't be in r2read.c.

/** Prototype of scanner function
 *
 * A scanner is simply a function that accepts a scanstate
 * object and returns the next token in that stream.
 * The function will typically be generated with the
 * assistance of re2c, but it doesn't have to be!
 *
 * Once you have created the scanstate data structure,
 * pass it to the scanner.  If the scanner returns 0,
 * you hit EOF.  If the scanner returns a negative number,
 * then some sort of error was encountered.  Or, if you're
 * doing nonblocking I/O, then it just might mean that this
 * there's not enough data available to determine the next
 * token.
