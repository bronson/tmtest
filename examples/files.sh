# If you include this file from your test file or a config file,
# you will have access to functions that make working with temporary
# files much easier.

# We want functions to:

# create a file with a random name in /tmp, pre-filled or not
# create a file with a given name in /tmp, pre-filled or not
# create a directory with a random name in /tmp, pre-filled or not
# create a directory with a given name in /tmp, pre-filled or not
