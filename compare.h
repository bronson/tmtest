So, cmp_ss_has_extra_nl means that ss didn't end in a nl, ptr did, but other than that they were identical.  cm_ptr_has_more_nls means that ss did end in a nl, ptr did too, and ptr and ss were exactly the same except ptr has one more newline.  In summary: both of these mean that ptr has one more nl than ss.  It's just whether ss ended with a newline (cmp_ptr_has_more_nls) or not (cmp_ptr_has_extra_nl).
