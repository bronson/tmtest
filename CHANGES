- Standardized licensing: everything under my control is MIT, package is LGPL.
- When installing locally, it's ~/.tmlib.sh instead of ~/share/tmtest/tmlib.sh
- Bump to 0.92
- install now installs config files too.
- Added the --config option to override default config files.
- Added timing information to test summary.  Disable with new -q option.
- Created tmlib, a "standard library" for tests.
- We now stop running all tests if any test aborts.  DISABLE stops the current
  test but lets all other tests finish; ABORT stops testing altogether.
- Tests now start with /tmp as the cwd, not the testdir.
  The testdir is supplied in $TESTDIR (or $MYDIR inside the testfile)
