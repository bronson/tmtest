- Parser recognizes the difference between a file and a command better

0.3:    29 Mar 2004
- Made multi-line commands require continuations

- Added create file capability

0.2:	early Dec, 2001
- Make -o and -d print the correct number of successes and failures
- tmtest now reads the test from stdin if you specify "-" on cmdline
- Added a tmtest test harness.  Now tmtest tests itself.
