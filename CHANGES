- Created tmlib, a "standard library" for tests.
- We now stop running all tests if any test aborts.  DISABLE stops the current
  test but lets all other tests finish; ABORT stops testing altogether.
- Tests now start with /tmp as the cwd, not the testdir.
  The testdir is supplied in $TESTDIR (or $MYDIR inside the testfile)
