- write some tests to ensure binary transparency of stdout and stderr.
  (especially hit the newlines hard)
- Release next version.
----
- Added the INDENT function to tmlib.
- Bash3 has made it so that the RE can no longer appear on the same line as
  the MODIFY command.  I updated all tests and accelerated MODIFY deprecation.
- Added -n (--no-trailing-newline) capability to STDOUT and STDERR sections.
- Rewrote the re2c parser in C so we should now be totally binary transparent.
- Got rid of all AUTHOR and DATE automation.  Too heavyhanded.
- Standardized licensing: everything under my control is MIT, package is LGPL.
- When installing locally, it's ~/.tmlib.sh instead of ~/share/tmtest/tmlib.sh

- Bump to 0.92
- install now installs config files too.
- Added the --config option to override default config files.
- Added timing information to test summary.  Disable with new -q option.
- Created tmlib, a "standard library" for tests.
- We now stop running all tests if any test aborts.  DISABLE stops the current
  test but lets all other tests finish; ABORT stops testing altogether.
- Tests now start with /tmp as the cwd, not the testdir.
  The testdir is supplied in $TESTDIR (or $MYDIR inside the testfile)
