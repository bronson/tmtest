- If an output section is marked -n but ends with multiple newlines, we print
  a warning and fail it automatically.  We used to let this nonsense pass.
- Added the Cutest unit test framework.  Refactored compare.c.
- Got rid of MODIFY and all its code.  Use INDENT, REPLACE, or sed instead.

Released 0.94 on 2 Mar 2006
- NOTE: Bash3 has made it so that the regex can not appear on the same line as
  the MODIFY keyword.  I updated all tests and accelerated MODIFY deprecation.
- Added the INDENT and REPLACE functions to tmlib.
- Standardized licensing: everything under my control is MIT, package is LGPL.
- --dump-script now cleans up after itself (before we'd leave turds in /tmp).
- Now reports in the test results when child is terminated by a signal.
- When installing locally, it's ~/.tmlib.sh instead of ~/share/tmtest/tmlib.sh
- Added -n (--no-trailing-newline) capability to STDOUT and STDERR sections.
- Got rid of all AUTHOR and DATE automation.  Too heavyhanded.
- Added --patch/-p to do the same thing as --diff/-d.  Just feels natural.
- Now only "\nSTDOUT[ \t\r\n:]" starts a section.  Anything else is just data.
- Rewrote the re2c parser in C so we should now be totally binary transparent.

- Bump to 0.92
- Tests now start with /tmp as the cwd, not the testdir.
  The testdir is supplied in $TESTDIR (or $MYDIR inside the testfile)
- Added timing information to test summary.  Disable with new -q option.
- Added the --config option to override default config files.
- install now installs config files too.
- Created tmlib, a "standard library" for tests.
- We now stop running all tests if any test aborts.  DISABLE stops the current
  test but lets all other tests finish; ABORT stops testing altogether.
