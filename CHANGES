Changes that potentially break backward compatibility
are marked with a '*'.

TODO:
- make envvars work again
- make patching work when you supply multiple files
- allow headers or options to tell where to explode the file
- make it read a global configuration from /etc
- get rid of exit_value_hack
- make tmtest work with test files starting with a shebang
- add an alarm that will time out a stalled child processes
- maybe allow crfiles to work backwards too: "execfile: postscr = <<EOF".  Seems more natural, though technically wrong.
- work with spaces in the filenames.
- rename the eachline header, mabye fixstdout, fixstderr, and fixoutput?
- make debugging output much more presentable.
  - Split into parsing debug and running debug.
  - Turn it back into a one-letter option(s).
  - make -xf (debug config file) -xp (debug testfile parsing) -xc (syntax check) -dh (dump headers)
- fix the goddamn headers once and for all and break backward compat.
  - this will require rewriting the testfile parser.  Maybe move to C?
  - make headers and commands able to come in any order in the testfile.
  - get rid of test title grandfathering.
  - make it take the test title from the filename if a title isn't specified.
  - take the date from the mtime of the testfile if not specified?
- maybe backslash is overloaded.  $$ should escape a $ when interpolating, not \$?
- maybe add a switch to turn off header and command interpolation.
- maybe implement a related-to header, where a test can name related tests.
- maybe implement a keyword header and search?  add keywords to tests?
- maybe write a gui front-end

0.89:
- maybe make headers use = as well as :, appears cleaner for some headers.
- also made += be equivalent to "hdr = $(hdr) blah"
- Unfortunately, this breaks envvar syntax.  For now envvars aren't supported.
- Added -D: define headers using -Dheader=value or --define-header=header=value
- Now runs executable interpolation anywhere in command line, not just on first position.
- now output the byte-for-byte stdout and stderr when --verbose is on.

0.88:	3 Nov 2004		169/169 tests passed		r15
- Made interpolation support indirect args: $($(argname))
- Turned off bare interpolation, added interpolate-bare header to re-enable.
- Turned off interpolation by default, added the interpolate header to re-enable.
- Now supports setting environment variables using "VAR=val cmd"
- Simplified output processing, got rid of erroneous newlines.
- got rid of "+x" to mark a crfile executable.  It's now "execfile=".
- Made tmtest safer against tmpfile attacks. (no guarantee of coure over what tests do)
- create files are always deleted after the test runs regardless of success/fail.
* Changed the create file syntax since it conflicts with sh's setting of environment vars.
  It also resembles headers now so should be easier to remember.
  However, it breaks backward compatibility with testfiles that use createfiles.
- Added temporary create files.  Should always use this over traditional create files.
- Made headers preserve newlines in continuations.
  (the nls are converted to spaces when the command is executed).
- Added a warning when $(paren) or $bare and interpolating a nonexistant header.
- Now you can escape interpolations to pass $s on to the shell.
- Re-implemented bare interpolation.  Not sure I'm going to leave it in though.
- Now path search skips hidden files and directories.
- tmtest used to raise every child signal on itself.  Now only does it for INT.
- added header interpolation in heredocs and stdin.  dangerous... but very useful.
- Added support for heredocs in headers (been doc'd for a while but never impl'd).
- Start converting all -Z tests that fail to -o tests.  -Z exposes too many internals.

0.87:	29 Sep 2004
- Now uses Getopt::Long for more sensible argument handling.
- Added -e option: explodes the command, runnable, into a directory in /tmp.
- Deprecated -h and -c (print heredoc and cmd) -- -e works much better.
- testfile now uses rfc822-style headers and shell-style cmd continuations.
- Made the output clause optional (especially useful with -o)
- No longer counts disabled tests as failures.
- Made the -d option generate a legal patchfile ("tmtest -d | patch"!).
- Now skip every file that doesn't end in .test, even if named on command line.
- Added a sigabrt handler to possibly help with asserts.
- Added -v to start an editor on the test file.  Just a shortcut.

0.86:	20 July 2004
- no longer requires a configuration file to run
- add -f option to explicitly specify a configuration file
- changed config file name to "tmtest.conf"
- Now scans all of a test's parent dirs looking for tmtest.conf files.
- config file now uses testfile syntax
- got rid of most config variables.  they will be replaced by config file headers.
- tmtest is now globally installable (runs from /usr/bin as well as local dirs)
- deprecated the -c syntax check option (it's still available as -Z for now)
- made exit_code_re not so strict.  It uses any integer it can find.
- added the executable header to replace the executablepath config var.
- executable now applies only to the command, not the entire command line.
- decouple platform-specific errnos from the exit code -- we always return 255 if there was an error.
- added the -c option that shows the exact command executed
- now adds quotes around command name when it contains any whitespace
- added the eachline, curfile, and curpath headers
- added interpolating headers into other headers and into commands.
- added the include directive (only includes headers for now)
- tmtest now prints line numbers in error messages starting at 1 (like the
  rest of the sane world) instead of at 0.

0.82:	23 Jun 2004
- Made it handle here documents in a pipeline correctly.
- No longer mistakes '<<key' or \<\<key to be here docs.
- No longer misses the command substitution if the command appears alone
  in the testfile or mashed up to a heredoc or a pipe.
- Commands and Create Files now preserve their order (crfiles used to always be first)
- Added the -h option to dump heredocs.
- Fixed bug where extra newline was added to empty here documents.
- added a "require" header that skips the test if tmtest version is too old.
- added disabling tests (the "disable: yes" or "enable: no" header).

0.8:	31 Mar 2004
- No longer need to prefix headers with '#' (but it still works if you do)
- Can now have an unlimited number of headers of any name.
- Headers can be continued by following them with a \
- here docs: whitespace to be stripped is now taken from the first NONBLANK line.
- Headers may now include comments.
- Added some manpages.

0.4:   30 Mar 2004
- Added ability to redirect command output somewhere else
- Added ability to set up command pipelines
- Created files can now be marked executable (file = +x <<HERE)
- Can now run multiple commands in a single script
- Added the -P option (display debugging info).
- Removed -v (verbose) since it really wasn't used anymore
- Files now remain in the order they were declared (turned hash into array)
- Parser recognizes the difference between a file and a command better

0.3:    29 Mar 2004
- Made multi-line commands require continuations
- Avoids shell when passing here doc (it would corrupt leading whitespace).
- Added create file capability
- Headers now require designators (author:, date:)
- Fixed tab stripping in here documents (appeared to work but didn't really)
- Made tmtest-config file simpler, added defaults for almost everything.

0.2:	early Dec, 2001
- Make -o and -d print the correct number of successes and failures
- tmtest now reads the test from stdin if you specify "-" on cmdline
- Added a tmtest test harness.  Now tmtest tests itself.
- Make it read here documents properly.  Before, it would sorta fake it.
- Made here documents support <<- to strip leading tab chars (like bash)
- No longer strip whitespace from test file

0.1:	2000
- initial release
