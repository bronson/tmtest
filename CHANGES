0.9 TODO
- make -df (debug config file) -dp (debug testfile parsing) -dc (syntax check) -dh (dump headers)
- keywords?

0.88:
- make debugging output much more presentable
- make tmtest work with test files starting with a shebang
- get rid of exit_value_hack
- add an alarm that will time out a stalled child processes
- allow headers or options to tell where to explode the file
- fix the goddamn headers once and for all
- make it read a global configuration from /etc
- make it unnecessary to enter filenames: it should name them for you.  Maybe :1:, then substitute $1 in the commands.

0.87:	29 Sep 2004
- Now uses Getopt::Long for more sensible argument handling.
- Added -e option: explodes the command, runnable, into a directory in /tmp.
- Deprecated -h and -c (print heredoc and cmd) -- -e works much better.
- testfile now uses rfc822-style headers and shell-style cmd continuations.
- Made the output clause optional (especially useful with -o)
- No longer counts disabled tests as failures.
- Made the -d option generate a legal patchfile ("tmtest -d | patch"!).
- Now skip every file that doesn't end in .test, even if named on command line.
- Added a sigabrt handler to possibly help with asserts.
- Added -v to start an editor on the test file.  Just a shortcut.

0.86:	20 July 2004
- no longer requires a configuration file to run
- add -f option to explicitly specify a configuration file
- changed config file name to "tmtest.conf"
- Now scans all of a test's parent dirs looking for tmtest.conf files.
- config file now uses testfile syntax
- got rid of most config variables.  they will be replaced by config file headers.
- tmtest is now globally installable (runs from /usr/bin as well as local dirs)
- deprecated the -c syntax check option (it's still available as -Z for now)
- made exit_code_re not so strict.  It uses any integer it can find.
- added the executable header to replace the executablepath config var.
- executable now applies only to the command, not the entire command line.
- decouple platform-specific errnos from the exit code -- we always return 255 if there was an error.
- added the -c option that shows the exact command executed
- now adds quotes around command name when it contains any whitespace
- added the eachline, curfile, and curpath headers
- added interpolating headers into other headers and into commands.
- added the include directive (only includes headers for now)
- tmtest now prints line numbers in error messages starting at 1 (like the
  rest of the sane world) instead of at 0.

0.82:	23 Jun 2004
- Made it handle here documents in a pipeline correctly.
- No longer mistakes '<<key' or \<\<key to be here docs.
- No longer misses the command substitution if the command appears alone
  in the testfile or mashed up to a heredoc or a pipe.
- Commands and Create Files now preserve their order (crfiles used to always be first)
- Added the -h option to dump heredocs.
- Fixed bug where extra newline was added to empty here documents.
- added a "require" header that skips the test if tmtest version is too old.
- added disabling tests (the "disable: yes" or "enable: no" header).

0.8:	31 Mar 2004
- No longer need to prefix headers with '#' (but it still works if you do)
- Can now have an unlimited number of headers of any name.
- Headers can be continued by following them with a \
- here docs: whitespace to be stripped is now taken from the first NONBLANK line.
- Headers may now include comments.
- Added some manpages.

0.4:   30 Mar 2004
- Added ability to redirect command output somewhere else
- Added ability to set up command pipelines
- Created files can now be marked executable (file = +x <<HERE)
- Can now run multiple commands in a single script
- Added the -P option (display debugging info).
- Removed -v (verbose) since it really wasn't used anymore
- Files now remain in the order they were declared (turned hash into array)
- Parser recognizes the difference between a file and a command better

0.3:    29 Mar 2004
- Made multi-line commands require continuations
- Avoids shell when passing here doc (it would corrupt leading whitespace).
- Added create file capability
- Headers now require designators (author:, date:)
- Fixed tab stripping in here documents (appeared to work but didn't really)
- Made tmtest-config file simpler, added defaults for almost everything.

0.2:	early Dec, 2001
- Make -o and -d print the correct number of successes and failures
- tmtest now reads the test from stdin if you specify "-" on cmdline
- Added a tmtest test harness.  Now tmtest tests itself.
- Make it read here documents properly.  Before, it would sorta fake it.
- Made here documents support <<- to strip leading tab chars (like bash)
- No longer strip whitespace from test file

0.1:	2000
- initial release
